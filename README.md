# Autofill


Program to replicate an autofill system by using a TRIE data structure built off of some search history. It is able to take in the first fraction of a word and return up to the top 5 results depending if there are enough for 5 or return no results found if it can't find any results.

This was the final challenge to level 4 of the hello world python course taught by Reed Coke.
